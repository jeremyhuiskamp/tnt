# Typographical Number Theorem

This is a simple golang libary for parsing and reasoning about strings of
Typographical Number Theorem as described in Chapter 8 of "GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach"
by Douglas Hofstadter.

It is probably not very useful.  It's main purpose is to make operations on the
strings explicit, so as to avoid mistakes made by intuitive assumptions.
